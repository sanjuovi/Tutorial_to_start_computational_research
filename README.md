# Tutorial_to_start_computational_research
This tutorial is a record of the steps I followed when starting my journey in computational research. I began with zero experience in coding, comput. tools, or resources in this field. My aim is to provide a basic, beginner-friendly guide for others like me who may have limited resources or experience and to serve as a future reference for myself.
